We created this project originally as an assingment - which is coding the ls command from linux

To complete this project, we used a couple of online resources has reference, these are all listed here specifically

We tested all variations we thought of when it came to the flags some of which are listed below:
    UnixLs 
    UnixLs -i
    UnixLs -il
    UnixLs -li
    UnixLs -ilR
    etc. 

An example of some of these outputs are included in the example.txt file included.
The code was tested with a number of variations of the flags
